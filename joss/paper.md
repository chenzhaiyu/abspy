# Summary

Efficient and robust space partitioning of 3D space underpins many applications in computer graphics. *abspy* is a Python package for adaptive binary space partitioning and 3D modeling. At its core, *abspy* constructs a plane arrangement by recursively subdividing 3D space with planar primitives to form a linear cell complex that reflects the underlying geometric structure. This adaptive scheme iteratively refines the spatial decomposition, producing a compact representation that supports efficient 3D modeling and analysis. Built on robust computational techniques and interoperable data structures, *abspy* provides a flexible framework for advanced operations such as surface reconstruction, volumetric analysis, and feature extraction for machine learning.

# Statement of need

In many scientific and engineering workflows, raw 3D data must be transformed into compact volumetric models for visualization, simulation, and analysis of complex 3D environments. Traditional fixed-grid representations (e.g., voxels) or exhaustive plane-arrangement approaches [@edelsbrunner1986constructing] often either introduce discretization errors or incur prohibitive computational costs, or both. A central challenge is to partition ambient space into a minimal yet meaningful set of units that faithfully capture geometric detail. Adaptive binary space partitioning [@murali1997consistent] addresses this challenge by dynamically subdividing 3D space according to the data's intrinsic features, constructing a plane arrangement that conforms to geometric boundaries. Despite its theoretical advantages, no high-level implementation has been readily available for modern research use cases. *abspy* fills this gap by offering a modern, user-friendly API for adaptive partitioning, enabling reliable and efficient 3D modeling. Researchers can thus tackle large-scale and complex reconstruction challenges with great reliability and precision. Unlike general-purpose libraries such as CGAL [@fabri2009cgal] and Open3D [@zhou2018open3d], which primarily focus on versatile low-level tools, *abspy* uniquely integrates adaptive binary space partitioning and exact arithmetic within a single, Python-native framework, facilitating direct integration into research workflows tailored for compact, dynamic 3D modeling tasks and beyond.

\autoref{fig:2d} illustrates how *abspy* uses user-supplied or extracted planar primitives to recursively subdivide space into a convex cell complex. Initially developed for research purposes, *abspy* has since evolved to support diverse 3D applications, particularly for compact surface reconstructions. It has been employed in several research projects and featured in scientific publications [@chen2022points2poly; @chen2024polygnn; @sulzer2024concise] as well as graduate students' projects.

# Overview of features

The core features of *abspy* include:

- **Planar primitive manipulation:** *abspy* extracts planar primitives from point clouds or meshes, and refines or perturbs the primitives to control noise, ensuring a robust representation of the input geometric structures.
- **Linear cell complex construction:** Using adaptive binary space partitioning, *abspy* recursively subdivides 3D space into a cell complex that reflects the dataâ€™s spatial layout. This structured decomposition facilitates efficient spatial queries and further processing.
- **Dynamic graph generation:** The package iteratively constructs and updates a BSP-tree as a dynamic graph, supporting operations like connectivity analysis and neighborhood searches.
- **Robust spatial operations:** By leveraging the rational ring from SageMath [@sage2024sage], *abspy* performs exact geometric computations that avoid inaccuracies associated with floating-point arithmetic, leading to reliable intersection tests and robust boundary determinations.
- **Surface reconstruction:** *abspy* identifies boundaries between interior and exterior cells to reconstruct polygonal surfaces using graph cuts, enabling the generation of surface models suitable for visualization and analysis.
- **Ease of integration:** With a Pythonic interface, comprehensive documentation, and practical examples, *abspy* integrates smoothly into existing research workflows. Its data structures are designed for interoperability with tools such as NetworkX [@hagberg2008exploring] and Easy3D [@nan2021easy3d], facilitating further development.
