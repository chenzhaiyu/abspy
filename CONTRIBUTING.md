# Questions, bugs, and feature requests

Please have a look at the [documentation](https://abspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and 
quickly go through the [issues](https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/abspy/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if the same question has already been answered before you ask a question.
Please choose `Blank issue` for general questions, `Bug report` for reporting bugs, and `Feature request` for requesting features.

## Contributing a bug fix

Bug fixes are highly appreciated. __There is no preferred patch size__.  A one-character fix is just as welcome as a thousand line one if that is the appropriate size for the fix.

It is recommended to create a pull request for a bug fix. A complete bug fix includes:

- description of the incorrect behavior;
- change of the code;
- credits entries for all authors of the bug fix.

## Contributing a feature

__Note:__ If you haven't already implemented the feature, check first if there
already is an open issue for it and if it's already being developed in a
[development branch](https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/abspy/branches/all).

__Note:__ You must have all necessary rights to any code you contribute.  If you
did not write the code yourself, you must explain where it came from and under
what license.  Even code using the same license as *abspy* may not be copied
without attribution.

A complete feature includes:

- the code (i.e., implementation of the new feature);
- a change log including a description of the new feature;
- reference documentation (like other existing features);
- a minimal example;
- cross-references and mentions in relevant places (if needed);
- credits entries for all authors of the new feature.

If the feature requires platform-specific code, at minimum stubs must be added
for the new platform function to all supported and experimental platforms.
